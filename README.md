### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Kyler: a embedded systems engineer in training with a focus on implementation of hardware optimizations. I am a <s>first</s> <i><s>second</s></i> <i><s>third</s></i> <b>fourth</b> year college student studying computer science with a focus on computer systems.
In my offtime, I enjoy developing my skills as a creative writer, backpacker, tabletop gamer, and SCUBA Diver.

I started coding 6 years ago, and developed my first major project, _Dwelt_ in 2022 as a technical test during my first year of college. my future goals in coding are to complete my new focus project, 
<i>can't say too much yet, more soon</i>, and to keep learning more about procedural generation techniques based in automota theory and linear diffusion. 

### What do I do?
  Primarily, I like to code in C, Verilog, and Python. Currently I am participating in research into alternative computing techniques at the University of Minnesota.

### Colaboration on Projects
I would love to collaborate on any coding projects within my current skillset, so if you want to cooperate on coding projects in Verilog/Python/C/C++, feel free to contact me.
